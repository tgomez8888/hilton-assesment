Clone project.
git clone git@github.com:tgomez8888/hilton-assesment.git

To run the project run following commands in terminal

yarn install
yarn start

or you could run docker-compose up

either way page should be available in http://localhost:3000

for running the test, just run yarn test and then press 'a' to run all tests (Didn't have enough time to fix the tests of the components now with redux, I did only one test of the action/reducer/selector. Code itself is working as the one with component state).
